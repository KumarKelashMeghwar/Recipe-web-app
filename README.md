# Recipe-web-app

I have uploaded the frontend and backend code. The whole website is dynamic and built on MERN stack.

## For running the frontend which in on React JS:
- Just jump inside that frontend directory
- open terminal there and run "npm install --force" which will download all dependencies and will create node_modules directory
- now just run "npm start" and project will start running


(Configuration has been made in such a way that process of running the code is same)
## For running backend which is on Node JS:
- Again jump inside that directory and open terminal or command prompt there
- run command 'npm install --force' which will download all dependencies and will create node_modules directory
- now just run "npm start" and project will start running

Note: Please delete package-lock.json file if "npm install --force" don't get the job done!

That's it.


## What the webapp is about?
It's is simple and straightforward web app built on using MERN Stack. The app is about publishing recipes of different foods.
Users can register, login, view, edit, star or delete recipes. The webapp also shows newly published and most popular recipes in different sections.

Stack: MERN
MongoDB, Express JS, React JS and Node Js.

Popular Libraries used with React JS are following:
- axios

Famous Libraries used for backend (NodeJS):
- sendgrid
- bcrypt
- body-parser
- cors
- dotenv
- express
- jsonwebtoken

That's all.
Thank you!
